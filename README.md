# summerfish-swagger

With SummerFish we bring to Go developers a way of having swagger documentation auto-generated with no annotations needed!

This package contains a golang implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)):
it knows how to serialize and deserialize swagger specifications.

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.<br>

##  Features
`summerfish-swagger` brings to the go community a way of generating swagger documentation without needing any annotations or changes on the your code. It is also integrated with the Swagger UI to help you serving as one endpoint.

##  Project status
`summerfish-swagger` is still very early in its life.
